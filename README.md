# BogusCode
## Vimeo Mobile Engineer Coding Exercise

BogusCode is an app that tries to display a list of the most recent videos in the Vimeo Staff Picks channel, but it has a number of issues that make the user experience quite poor, and the code itself is no better.  You’ve inherited this tiny but unintelligible codebase, and your task is to bring it up to your own standard of quality.  Correct all the issues you see, both in user experience and code quality.  Refactor as you see fit, and make BogusCode maintainable and robust.  We’re primarily looking for big advancements in the areas of architecture, performance, and clarity.  Adding features is not necessary, but could be worth some bonus points if you have time.  With your returned submission, submit a (very brief) summary of the issues you found, the changes you made to correct them, and why those changes were important.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have, good luck!
